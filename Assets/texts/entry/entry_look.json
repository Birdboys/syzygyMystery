	"0":"The entryway to the apartment. A decorative floor mat and minimal coat rack mark the only flare in an upscale yet woefully barebones apartment. Hallways leading to the closet, bathroom, and bedroom are all visible, as is the open kitchen to the left.",

	"floor_matunder":"You grab the least filthy corner of the mat and lift. When the dust settles, you can see a small metal key laying on the floor."
